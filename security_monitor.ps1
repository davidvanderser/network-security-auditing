SCRIPT OBJECTIVE
================================================================================
The objective of the security_monitor.ps1 script is to simulate a host-based
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) or Security Information and Event Management 
(SIEM) monitoring solution. It acts as an automated integrity monitor for the 
Windows host system's cryptographic trust configuration.

Specifically, it achieves three goals:
1. Validates Trust Store Integrity: It continuously tracks the state of the 
   local machine's Trusted Root Certification Authorities database to detect 
   unauthorized, external modifications.
2. Identifies Key Interception IoCs: It targets and alerts on specific Indicators 
   of Compromise (IoCs)—such as the injection of a 'mitmproxy' certificate—which 
   signal that an active Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) pipeline has been deployed.
3. Automates Security Incident Response: It surfaces immediate, high-severity 
   visual warnings to the console interface when anomalies are detected, mimicking 
   how an enterprise defense agent reports critical security events.
