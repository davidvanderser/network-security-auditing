SCRIPT OBJECTIVE
================================================================================
The objective of the ping_monitor.py script is to act as a lightweight, 
passive network intrusion detection filter (IDS). It verifies that the 
virtual network interfaces are operating correctly and monitors the traffic 
pattern across the isolated NAT network segment.

Specifically, it achieves three goals:
1. Confirms Live Traffic Visibility: It proves that your Kali Linux VM can 
   interact directly with the shared network layer and intercept raw packets 
   sent by other machines (like your Windows 10 VM).
2. Performs Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): It opens the data frames moving over 
   the network cable, identifies ICMP packets (the protocol used by ping), and 
   separates them into "Requests" and "Replies" based on their protocol header 
   type codes.
3. Logs Source & Destination Trails: It extracts the exact IP addresses of the 
   Communication endpoints in real-time, providing immediate visual proof that 
   your network connections are bridged properly.
